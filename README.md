 * 
 * - there is no requirement to implement any AI to maximise a player's
 *   score, playing a valid move at random is fine
 * - the simulation should print out a description of every move played,
 *   e.g. player 1 picked up [4, 2] ... player 2 played [1, 4] adjacent 
 *   to [1, 1] ... player 1 played [4, 2] adjacent to [1, 4]
 * - bonus points for rendering / printing a visual representation of the 
 *   board at the end of the simulation
 * - document any assumptions you've made or any rules that you weren't
 *   able to implement fully
